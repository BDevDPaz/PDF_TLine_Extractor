### Database Design
Uses **SQLite** with SQLAlchemy ORM featuring a comprehensive data model optimized for telecommunications data:
- `extracted_data` table: Complete storage for all 8 critical data fields:
  - `phone_line`: The telephone line associated with the event (format: cleaned 10-digit number)
  - `event_type`: Type of event (Llamada, Mensaje, Datos)
  - `timestamp`: Complete date and time with hour/minute precision
  - `direction`: Event direction (ENTRANTE, SALIENTE, CONSUMO)
  - `contact`: Cleaned phone number or contact information
  - `description`: Structured description including location, type, and cost details
  - `value`: Duration in minutes (calls), count (messages), or data quantity (usage)
  - `source_file`: File tracking for data lineage and integrity

The database supports chronological organization, complete record replacement per source file, and maintains data consistency through transaction-based operations.
