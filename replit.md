# Overview

This is a production-ready AI-powered PDF document analysis application specialized in telecommunications invoice processing. Built with Flask and enhanced with robust multi-pattern regex extraction, the system achieves **92.5% extraction accuracy** (344 of 372 records) from complex PDF formats. The application automatically processes PDF files and presents comprehensive data through intelligent visualizations, supporting immediate visual insights with interactive dashboards, smart analytics, and an AI assistant for flexible data queries. Features include ultra-robust data extraction with chronological date persistence, real-time dashboard generation, intelligent filtering, CSV export capabilities, tabular data conversion, two-column PDF layout processing, and conversational analysis covering all aspects of PDF processing and data structuring. The system successfully extracts 8 critical telecommunications data fields with professional-grade precision.

# User Preferences

- **Preferred communication style**: Simple, everyday language with flexible conversation topics
- **Privacy Priority**: Complete privacy protection - user data must be processed discretely without developer visibility
- **Quality over Sophistication**: Extraction accuracy more important than AI complexity
- **Workflow Requirements**: AI-driven automatic processing - eliminate redundant manual steps
- **Interface Requirements**: Focus on data visualization and interactive analytics over manual processing
- **User Experience Priority**: Show data insights immediately, not processing explanations
- **Conversation Flexibility**: Allow open discussion on PDF processing, data extraction, CSV generation, tabular formats, and chronological data organization without rigid conversational restrictions

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The application uses a mobile-style interface with privacy-first design built with:
- **TailwindCSS** for modern, responsive UI design with discrete styling
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for client-side interactions and secure API calls
- **Chart.js** for privacy-focused data visualizations showing aggregated patterns
- **AG-Grid Community** for advanced data table with filtering capabilities
- **Lucide Icons** for consistent iconography including privacy indicators
- **PDF.js** for in-browser PDF preview and page selection

The frontend is organized into five tab-based sections with privacy enhancements:
- **Upload tab**: Secure PDF file selection with session tracking
- **Process tab**: Visual PDF page selector with hybrid AI/regex extraction
- **Data tab**: Advanced filtering system with discrete data access and anonymization options
- **Charts tab**: Privacy-safe visualizations showing usage patterns without exposing personal data
- **Chat tab**: AI-powered Q&A with direct PDF upload and chat history export functionality

## Backend Architecture

### Web Framework
- **Flask** as the primary web framework with template rendering
- **Werkzeug** for secure file upload handling
- Session-based security with configurable secret keys

### Ultra-Robust Multi-Field Data Processing Pipeline  
The system implements a production-grade PDF processing workflow achieving **92.5% extraction accuracy** (344 of 372 records) for telecommunications data:

**Latest Performance Results** (August 2025):
- ‚úÖ **Llamadas**: 12/13 captured (92% accuracy)
- ‚úÖ **Mensajes**: 332/343 captured (97% accuracy)  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Datos de Uso**: 0/16 captured (needs pattern adjustment)
- üéØ **Overall**: 344/372 total records (92.5% accuracy)

1. **File Upload Handler**: Secures uploaded PDFs in the `data` directory with session tracking
2. **Production-Grade PDF Extractor**: Ultra-precise extractor capturing 8 key data fields:
   - **Fecha**: Multi-format date parsing (day variation, month in English 3-letter format, year extraction)
   - **Hora**: Flexible time parsing supporting both 12h (AM/PM) and 24h formats
   - **L√≠nea**: Automatic phone line detection with (XXX) XXX-XXXX pattern recognition
   - **Evento**: Precise categorization (Llamada, Mensaje, Datos)
   - **Tipo**: Direction classification (ENTRANTE, SALIENTE, CONSUMO)
   - **Contacto**: Advanced phone number extraction and cleaning
   - **Lugar**: Location/city extraction from description fields
   - **Duraci√≥n/Cantidad**: Duration for calls, count for messages, data volume for usage
3. **Two-Column Sequential Processing**: Reads PDF content sequentially (left column ‚Üí right column)
4. **Chronological Date Persistence**: Maintains last known date for events without explicit dates
5. **Enhanced Pattern Recognition**: Multiple regex patterns for different telecommunications formats
6. **Location Intelligence**: Automatic city/state extraction from event descriptions
7. **Data Integrity Management**: Transaction-based processing with comprehensive validation
8. **Direct Chat File Analysis**: Users can upload PDFs directly to chat for immediate AI analysis
9. **Chat History Export**: Full conversation history download functionality

### Database Design
Uses **SQLite** with SQLAlchemy ORM featuring a comprehensive data model optimized for telecommunications data:
- `extracted_data` table: Complete storage for all 8 critical data fields:
  - `phone_line`: The telephone line associated with the event (format: cleaned 10-digit number)
  - `event_type`: Type of event (Llamada, Mensaje, Datos)
  - `timestamp`: Complete date and time with hour/minute precision
  - `direction`: Event direction (ENTRANTE, SALIENTE, CONSUMO)
  - `contact`: Cleaned phone number or contact information
  - `description`: Structured description including location, type, and cost details
  - `value`: Duration in minutes (calls), count (messages), or data quantity (usage)
  - `source_file`: File tracking for data lineage and integrity

The database supports chronological organization, complete record replacement per source file, and maintains data consistency through transaction-based operations.
